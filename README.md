# LAX-Flight-Prediction

##Utilizing feature engineering and a suite of machine learning techniques to classify flights as on-time or delayed

If you have ever visited Google Flights and made a flight plan, you may have noticed that Google will warn you if a flight is frequently delayed. Using public data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, a model was trained to best replicate this process in R. This was  a collaborative effort at UCLA with fellow students Alex Krebs and Echo Wang.

As of July 2016 the code is being organized for clarity and is intended to be expanded with new features and new algorithms in an attempt to obtain better ROC results.
