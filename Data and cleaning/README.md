This section contains the raw, unedited CSV  and RData files, as well as initial cleaning and feature engineering code. Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexjkrebs/">Alex Krebs</a> for contributing several pieces of this code and for teaching me the methods he used. 

<b>Important note</b>: Only use the CSV if you have trouble with the RData file because the CSV file is YUGE!
